# NeoVim Config

Note that this repository doesn't contain the entirety of my `~/.config/nvim` folder.
It only contains my own configuration/code, which doesn't already have its own
separate repository. That said, all the plugins, colorschemes, etc. which I use
are specified in `init.vim`, so it should be easy enough to find and install them.
